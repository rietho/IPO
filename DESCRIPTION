Description: The outcome of XCMS data processing strongly depends on
 the parameter settings. IPO (`Isotopologue Parameter Optimization`)
 is a parameter optimization tool that is applicable for different
 kinds of samples and liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution
 mass spectrometry devices, fast and free of labeling steps.
 IPO uses natural, stable 13C isotopes to calculate a peak picking
 score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing the
 relative retention time differences within features and grouping
 parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of features showing
 exactly one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The
 different parameter settings are achieved by design of
 experiment. The resulting scores are evaluated using response surface
 models.
